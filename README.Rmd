# 2024 Presidential Forecast

This repository contains the code for running a dynamic and hierarchical Bayesian model that forecasts election outcomes in states, the nation, and the electoral college. The model is written in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and the supporting pipeline is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

The model improves upon the [Economist's 2020 model](https://github.com/TheEconomist/us-potus-model) (which, in turn, improved upon [Pierre Kemp's implementation](https://www.slate.com/features/pkremp_forecast/report.html) of [Drew Linzer's model](https://votamatic.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Linzer-JASA13.pdf)) by estimating the parameters used to generate state covariance matrices, rather than being passed the matrices as data. I intend to write a formal explanation of the model, likely after the election has concluded. In the interim, you can view a brief overview of the model definition in the [README in the `stan/` folder](https://github.com/markjrieke/2024-potus/tree/main/stan).

A more general overview of the model methodology can be found [here](https://www.thedatadiary.net/posts/2024-07-04-forecast-methodology/), and the full output can be explored [here](https://www.thedatadiary.net/2024-potus/national).

## Version history

### 2.5

###### 2024-09-12

* Updated state and national headline text to refer to raw probability, rather than ratings.
* Removed rating textbar above state map.
* Set state bubble color and summary bar fill based on a continuous gradient scaled by candidate probability of winning.
* Added linked interactivity between map and bar.
* Updated css to `cursor:pointer` when hovering over the map/bar to more intuitively suggest that users can click and be taken to the state pages.

### 2.4

###### 2024-09-03

* Added ActiVote to the [banned pollsters list](https://github.com/markjrieke/2024-potus/blob/main/data/static/banned_pollsters.csv).

### 2.3

###### 2024-08-19

* Added a filter to drop poll questions with a `NA` sample size. 
  * This was previously an implicit drop. 
  * If a poll included multiple populations, but had incomplete sample size data for the [best population](https://github.com/markjrieke/2024-potus/blob/main/data/static/population_rank.csv), the entire poll could have been dropped.
  * This ensures that the poll is included provided at least one of the populations has sample size data.

### 2.2

###### 2024-08-12

* Added a model review/diagnostic display under `out/REVIEW.md`

### 2.1

###### 2024-08-11

* Added conditional probability plot functions for the National page.

### 2.0

###### 2024-08-03

#### Harris Model

* Modified the prior/polling stan models and supporting R pipelines to support Kamala Harris as the democratic candidate. More details can be found in the `stan/` directory README.
* Updated site functions' internal variable naming and public facing candidate names to refer to Kamala Harris.
* Updated time-series plots on site to only display projections from 8/1 onwards. 
* Updated function documentation and READMEs based on new output.
* Fully re-ran the entire model from 5/1 onwards. An archived version of the final run with Biden as the democratic candidate can be found in the [`archive-biden`](https://github.com/markjrieke/2024-potus/tree/archive-biden) branch in this repository.

#### Other Fixes

* Corrected the need to run the polling model with the `prior_check` flag for run dates before 5/7. ([#10](https://github.com/markjrieke/2024-potus/issues/10))
* `render_interactive_map()` now correctly renders the ggobj passed as an argument, rather than looking for a specific object in the global environment.
* Fixed a small bug causing the prior stan model to underestimate uncertainty in the combination of the estimated national voteshare and state partisan lean.

### 1.2

###### 2024-07-16

* [Added conditional probability as a poll model output](https://github.com/markjrieke/2024-potus/commit/6eee3a3a8d08b6df66f71c3961e049fd91494c79).
* The output is not yet made available in the UI, but will be as a result of a later release.

### 1.1

###### 2024-07-14

* Modified header text to include the article "the" on D.C.'s state page.

### 1.0

###### 2024-07-04

* Initial release
